# Update token limits on mainnet

If you are trying to whitelist and update token limits many addresses at once, you will need to use the bulkSetTokenLockBurnLimit.js script. If you need to only update the lock or burn limit and the token has already been whitelisted, use the setTokenLockBurnLimit script.

Before running the following script go to the data folder and open create a file called `whitelist_<network>_<date>.json`, for example `whitelist_ethereum_feb_21_2021.json`. Change the name of the file to remove the date and insert the current date. Copy the contents from `limitWhitelistUpdate.json` into your newly created file and change the addresses to the address you want to whitelist. Then, update the limit to the desired limit you would like to allow a user to move through the bridge in a single tx. If you want to set this to the max allowable value in solidity, set the limit value to `115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007913129639935` which is the UINT_MAX in solidity.

Make sure ETHEREUM_PRIVATE_KEY in your .env file is the private key matching the OPERATOR address and ensure INFURA_PROJECT_ID is set correctly. Get the bridgebank address and set it in the env var when running the script. To bulk update the whitelist and limits for each token, use bulkSetTokenLockBurnLimit.js like so:
```
ETHEREUM_PRIVATE_KEY=$eth_key_operator BRIDGEBANK_ADDRESS=$bridge_bank_address truffle exec scripts/bulkSetTokenLockBurnLimit.js --network develop ../data/whitelist_<network>_<date>.json
```

To update the limit amount for a token (other than Ethereum) that is already whitelisted, use:
```
UPDATE_ADDRESS="0x0d8cc4b8d15D4c3eF1d70af0071376fb26B5669b" truffle exec scripts/setTokenLockBurnLimit.js --network develop 1000000000000000000000
```

To update the Ethereum lock limit in the smart contract, use setTokenLockBurnLimit.js with address 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000:
```
UPDATE_ADDRESS="0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000" truffle exec scripts/setTokenLockBurnLimit.js --network develop 1000000000000000000000
```
