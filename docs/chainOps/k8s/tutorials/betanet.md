# Connecting to the Sifchain BetaNet with Kubernetes (k8s).

## Scaffold and deploy a new cluster

1. Switch to the root of the sifchain project.

2. import gotpl module

```
go get github.com/belitre/gotpl
```

3. Scaffold a new cluster:

```
rake "cluster:scaffold[<cluster>,<provider>]"
```

e.g.:

```
rake "cluster:scaffold[my-cluster,aws]"
```

where:

|Param|Description|
|-----|----------|
|`<cluster>`|A name for your new cluster.|
|`<provider>`|The cloud provider to use (currently only AWS is supported).|

4. Once complete, you'll notice that several Terraform files/folders have been setup inside of the `.live` directory. We recommend you leave the defaults as-is, but for those that have experience with Terraform, feel free to adjust the configuration as you see fit.

5. Deploy the cluster to AWS:

```
rake "cluster:deploy[<cluster>,<provider>]"
```

e.g.:

```
rake "cluster:deploy[my-cluster,aws]"
```

6. Once complete, you should see your cluster on your AWS account. You can also check using `kubectl`:

```
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces --kubeconfig ./.live/sifchain-aws-my-cluster/kubeconfig_sifchain-aws-my-cluster
```

Note: if you get 
```
Unable to connect to the server: getting credentials: exec: exec: "aws-iam-authenticator": executable file not found in $PATH
```
Install aws-iam-authenticator from
```
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/install-aws-iam-authenticator.html
```

## Deploy a new node

1. Generate a new mnemonic key for your node. This key is what your node will use to eventually sign transactions/blocks on the network.

```
rake "keys:generate:mnemonic"
```

Note: if you get _rake abort!_ error

run these commands
```
export GOPATH=~/go
export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin
```


2. Import your newly generated key:

```
rake "keys:import[<moniker>]"
```

where:

|Param|Description|
|-----|----------|
|`<moniker>`|The moniker or name of your node as you want it to appear on the network.|

e.g.:

```
rake "keys:import[my-node]"
```

3. Check that it's been imported accordingly:

```
sifnodecli keys show <moniker> --keyring-backend file 
```

4. Deploy a new node to your cluster and connect to an existing network:

```
rake "cluster:sifnode:deploy:peer[<cluster>,<chain_id>,<provider>,<namespace>,<image>,<image_tag>,<moniker>,<mnemonic>,<peer_address>,<genesis_url>]"
```

where:

|Param|Description|
|-----|----------|
|`<cluster>`|The name of your cluster.|
|`<chain_id>`|The Chain ID of the network (e.g.: sifchain).|
|`<provider>`|The cloud provider to use (currently only AWS is supported).|
|`<namespace>`|The Kubernetes namespace to use (e.g.: sifnode).|
|`<image>`|The image to pull down from Docker Hub (e.g.: sifchain/sifnoded).|
|`<image_tag>`|The image tag to use (this must be `mainnet-genesis`).|
|`<moniker>`|The moniker or name of your node as you want it to appear on the network.|
|`<peer_address>`|The address of the peer to connect to.|
|`<genesis_url>`|The URL of genesis file for the network.|

e.g.:

```
rake "cluster:sifnode:deploy:peer[my-cluster,sifchain,aws,sifnode,sifchain/sifnoded,mainnet-genesis,my-node,'my mnemonic',0d4981bdaf4d5d73bad00af3b1fa9d699e4d3bc0@44.235.108.41:26656,https://rpc.sifchain.finance/genesis]"
```

_Please note: the image tag *must* be `mainnet-genesis`._

5. Once deployed, check the status of the pods:

```
kubectl get pods -n sifnode --kubeconfig ./.live/sifchain-aws-my-cluster/kubeconfig_sifchain-aws-my-cluster
```

and you should see something that resembles the following:

```                            
NAME                           READY   STATUS     RESTARTS   AGE
sifnode-75464fcd4c-dsmzq       0/1     Init:0/2   0          10s
```

_It may take several minutes for your node to become active._

6. Once your node is active (Status of "Running"), you can view it's sync status by looking at the logs. Run:

```
kubectl -n sifnode logs <pod> --kubeconfig ./.live/sifchain-aws-my-cluster/kubeconfig_sifchain-aws-my-cluster
```

e.g.:

```
kubectl -n sifnode logs sifnode-65fbd7798f-6wqhb --kubeconfig ./.live/sifchain-aws-my-cluster/kubeconfig_sifchain-aws-my-cluster
```

Note: Before moving to further steps make sure that your node is synced upto the current block height. 
You can check this by comparing your logs from above command with the block height from
```
https://blockexplorer.sifchain.finance/blocks
```

## Stake to become a validator

In order to become a validator, that is a node which can participate in consensus on the network, you'll need to stake `rowan`.

1. If using testnet, obtain funds from the faucet.

2. Get the public key of your node:

```
rake "validator:keys:public[<cluster>,<provider>,<namespace>]"
```

e.g.:

```
rake "validator:keys:public[my-cluster,aws,sifnode]"
```
Note: This requires jq JSON processor if not installed install with ```sudo apt-get install jq```

3. Run the following command to become a validator:

sifnodecli tx staking create-validator \
    --commission-max-change-rate="0.1" \
    --commission-max-rate="0.1" \
    --commission-rate="0.1" \
    --amount="<amount>" \
    --pubkey=<pub_key> \
    --moniker=<moniker> \
    --chain-id=sifchain \
    --min-self-delegation="1" \
    --gas-prices="0.5rowan" \
    --from=<moniker> \
    --keyring-backend=file \
    --node tcp://rpc.sifchain.finance:80
```

Where:

|Param|Description|
|-----|----------|
|`<amount>`|The amount of rowan you wish to stake (the more the better). The precision used is 1e18.|
|`<pub_key>`|The public key of your node, that you got in the previous step.|
|`<moniker>`|The moniker (name) of your node.|

e.g.:

```
sifnodecli tx staking create-validator \
    --commission-max-change-rate="0.1" \
    --commission-max-rate="0.1" \
    --commission-rate="0.1" \
    --amount="1000000000000000000000rowan" \
    --pubkey=thepublickeyofyournode \
    --moniker=my-node \
    --chain-id=sifchain \
    --min-self-delegation="1" \
    --gas-prices="0.5rowan" \
    --from=my-node \
    --keyring-backend=file \
    --node tcp://rpc.sifchain.finance:80
```

4. It may take several blocks before your node appears as a validator on the network, but you can always check by running:

```
sifnodecli q tendermint-validator-set --node <node_rpc_address> --trust-node
```

e.g.:

```
sifnodecli q tendermint-validator-set --node tcp://rpc.sifchain.finance:80 --trust-node
```
