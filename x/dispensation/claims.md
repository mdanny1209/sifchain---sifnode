## Overview
- The module allows a user to create a Claim .
- A claim is record , stating that the user want to collect their rewards at the end of the week.
- A claim is deleted once the user is paid out.


## General use case

Any day of the week
1) Create claims through this api (on chain)
     Users send a create claim request from their address and provide the claim-type (LM/VS) as a parameter. The claims are valid until they are paid out.


On Friday ( No limitation on the day being friday )


2) Run a query to get all claims till that time , and create a list 
     Step(1) also emits a claim_created event , which can read to get the claims and create the list
    
3) This  list is an input for a function (This function is off-chain and not part of this module)  which iterates over the list and calculates the rewards earned by that address. This data is then used to create a distribution list . 
     
4) We run a distribution using the list from step (3). 
5) The transfers happen over the next few blocks (10 per block) . 
6) An event is emitted when a transfer to a user happens.The event is an indicator that the recipient has received the funds .This will be used by an external function to reset multipliers for the recievers.
