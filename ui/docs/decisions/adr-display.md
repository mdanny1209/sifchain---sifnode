  padding?: number; // If we want to always render things so they are aligned, sometimes you have to add 0's
  // e.g. if we set padding=3 1000.1000
  //                          1000.0001

  meaningfulDollar?: number; // I need to give this some thought to explain, but sometimes you just want to show enough decimals that makes a dollar amount make sense. e.g. If you have 1.123112314 btc ~= 55,517.87, most of the information you need is just contained in perhaps just 1.123 but if you only have 0.0001213 btc ~= 7.72 then you would have to show at least 0.00012. This won't have to be built initially but might show up eventually in product designs. The price is available inside of Asset, so this is probably easy to do. As above, needs more thinking though.

// but type: fixed means that you should be able to change the number of digits
